            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                My name is <em>Karan Bairagi</em>, and I am currently pursuing my studies in 
                <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> at Algonquin College. I come from 
                Karnal, a beautiful city in Haryana, India, often called the “Paris of Haryana.” 
                Moving to Canada has been an exciting step in my life because it allows me to explore 
                new opportunities and develop skills for my future career. I strongly believe that consistent effort leads to success, just like 
                solving 2<sup>2</sup> equals 4 — preparation always brings results.
            </p>

            <p>
                I consider myself a motivated and positive person who enjoys learning new technologies 
                and improving communication skills. My goal is to become a successful professional in 
                the digital media industry while continuously growing as a person.  Their 
                encouragement reminds me to stay focused, work hard, and never give up even when 
                challenges appear difficult.
            </p>
